# Lab 1: Create Teams and Nested Teams

## Objective
Learn how to organize users into teams and sub-teams for better permission management.


## Instructions

### Step 1: Navigate to Teams

1. Go to your **Organization Settings** in GitHub
2. Click **Teams** in the left navigation

### Step 2: Create a Main Team
1. Click **New Team**
2. Name your team: `[YOUR_NAME]-team`
3. Add a short description:
   ```
   [UOUR_NAME]'s team
   ```
4. Set **Team visibility** to **Visible** (so others can find it)
5. Click **Create Team**
6. Make sure that the base permissions are set to **read**

### Step 3: Add Members

1. Add yourself and the person(s) next to you to this team
   - Use their GitHub username
   - Assign **Member** role (default)

### Step 4: Create a Nested Team

1. Inside your main team page, click **Add a child team**
2. Name it (example): `ui-components`
3. Add a description:
   ```
   [YOU_NAME]'s nested team
   ```
4. Only add yourself to this team

### Step 5: Confirm Hierarchy

- Ensure your nested team appears under the main team
- Check that members are correctly assigned
